\section{Demonstrating the MAUP}

\subsection{Background}

<!-- introduce problem -->

Areal units in zoning systems amalgamate into objects that constitute the basic units for the observation and analysis of spatial phenomena [@Openshaw]. Yet, no gold standard for guiding the spatial aggregation process exists, with the validity of zonal objects subject to the arbitrary and modifiable decision-making of quantitative geographers. Problematically, the analysis of socioeconomic data involving areal units is encumbered by the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP): "the sensitivity of analytical results tot he definition of units for which data are collected." The MAUP constraint 

<!-- nature of MAUP -->

Highly problematic to areal data, the modifiable unit problem (MAUP) describes the sensitivity of spatial analysis to the definition of

\subsection{Data}

To demonstrate the MAUP issue, we analyse the correlation between property price data derived from Land Registry [@LandRegistry]

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# fit random intercept model - i.e. model intercept term which varies across MSOAs
OAdata$H_bad_Prop <- (OAdata$H_Vbad + OAdata$H_bad) / OAdata$pop

model.1 <- lmer(unemp ~ S_Rent + dis_ind + Ethnic + (1|MSOA_CD), data = OAdata)
summary(model.1)
