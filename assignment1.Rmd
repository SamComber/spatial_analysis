\section{Demonstrating the MAUP}

\subsection{Background}

<!-- introduce problem -->

Areal units in zoning systems amalgamate into objects that constitute the basic units for the observation and analysis of spatial phenomena [@Openshaw]. Yet, no gold standard for guiding the spatial aggregation process exists, with the validity of zonal objects subject to the arbitrary and modifiable decision-making of quantitative geographers. Problematically, the analysis of socioeconomic data involving areal units is encumbered by the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP): "the sensitivity of analytical results to the definition of units for which data are collected." According to the literature, the MAUP constrains the reliability of analyses for aggregated spatial data, as findings have shown varying results with the scale of aggregation and configuration of zoning systems [@ClarkAvery].

<!-- zoning problem + examples -->

In practice, the MAUP is condensed into two issues of possible scale and zoning sensitivity in model calibration which this paper will attempt to demonstrate in Section \ref{maup}. The first issue, described as the *scale problem*, is the variation in findings when data for zonal units are progressively aggregated. 

** EXPLAIN HOW MIGHT CHANGE CORRELATON COEFFICIENTS FROM FOTHERINGHAM (1991)  PUT IN EXAMPLES THEN STATE WHAT YOU WILL DO**

This has been demonstrated empirically by @YuleKendall who found correlations between what yields and potato yield 




<!-- aggregation problem + examples -->

The second issue, the *zoning problem*, pertains to the variation in findings when alternative combinations of zonal units are analysed when the scale or number of units are held constant [@Openshaw]. 

<!-- ecological fallacy problem (tie back to two issues of MAUP)-->


\subsection{Data}

To demonstrate the MAUP issue, we analyse the correlation between property price data derived from Land Registry [@LandRegistry]
